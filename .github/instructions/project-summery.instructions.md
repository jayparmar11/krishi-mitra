# AI Agent for Indian Agriculture – Hackathon Theme Summary

## Core Mission
To build a human-aligned, agentic AI-powered advisor for the Indian agriculture sector.  
This initiative, part of the Capital One Launchpad 2025 Hackathon, aims to foster innovation in AI to address real-world challenges in a high-impact domain.

## Primary Goal
The AI agent must function as a comprehensive and reliable advisor for a wide range of stakeholders in the Indian agricultural ecosystem:

- Farmers  
- Agricultural financiers  
- Vendors  

It should provide real-time, hyperlocal, and contextually relevant answers to a variety of agricultural and financial queries.

## Key Problem Areas

### Precision Agriculture & Crop Management
- Irrigation Scheduling:  
  “When should I irrigate?”
- Seed Selection:  
  “What seed variety suits this unpredictable weather?”
- Yield Protection:  
  “Will next week's temperature drop kill my yield?”

### Market & Financial Guidance
- Market Analysis:  
  “Can I afford to wait for the market to improve?”
- Financial Aid & Credit:  
  “Where can I get affordable credit, and will any state/central government policy help me with finances?”
